#VMControlGUI

I use a lot of Virtual Machines in VirtualBox and have a keyboard with macro keys, that I rarely use. So I decided to write a simple program to start/stop my VMs, that can be mapped to those macro keys. I can either control a specific VM or be prompted to choose from a list of all my VMs. To avoid unwanted VM starts during gaming (happens quite a lot), there is always a prompt, asking for confirmation, that I really want to start or stop a VM.  

I use this repo for trying out different things like argument parsing, shell commands or GUI prompts in python.
